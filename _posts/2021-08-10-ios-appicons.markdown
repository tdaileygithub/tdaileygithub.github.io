Yikes.  There are certainly no shortage of ways to omit something.  

## Use Icon-Set-Creator App

[https://apps.apple.com/de/app/icon-set-creator/id939343785]()

1. Create a large icon in gimp and then drag it in to the tool and generate.
2. Replace the Assets.xcassets\AppIcon.appiconset folder with the generated contents.

Nice.  That is certainly better than scaling by hand.
